This project is a simple game of blackout. The objective of this game is to get all the colors; either black or yellow, to be the same on the gameboard. When clicking on the
gameboard, the grids around the selected grid will change to the opposing color. Prior to playing the game, you have an option to input a predefined gameboard. If you don't
have one, the program will create a random 5 by 5 grid gameboard for you. During the game, you have the option to save the game or quit it as it may seem impossible to get
all of the colors on the gameboard to be the same.
